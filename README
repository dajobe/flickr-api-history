History of the methods in the Flickr API as recorded by me
running the flickcurl list-methods example program which calls
  flickr.reflection.getMethods
  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.reflection.getMethods.html

The best view of this is the 'blame' or 'annotate' view of the methods.lst file which shows at what date time (approximately), new API calls were added.

PS This was converted from raw files -> RCS -> CVS -> GIT so there are
probably conversion artifacts and the timezone was set to UTC.
